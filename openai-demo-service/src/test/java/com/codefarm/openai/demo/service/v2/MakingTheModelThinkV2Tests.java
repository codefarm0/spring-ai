/**
 * This test class demonstrates techniques for making AI models perform multi-step reasoning tasks.
 * It explores how to structure prompts that require the model to break down complex problems
 * into discrete steps and show its work.
 *
 * The class showcases:
 * - Multi-step task decomposition
 * - Cross-language processing
 * - Data extraction and transformation
 * - Structured output generation
 *
 * These tests help validate that the AI model can follow a chain of logical steps
 * while maintaining accuracy across different types of operations.

        In a bustling tech startup, two developers, Alex and Sam, embarked on
        a mission to fix a critical bug before the product launch.
        As they worked through the night, debugging tirelessly, disaster
        struckâ€”their main database server crashed, with Sam's recent changes
        potentially causing the issue. Though exhausted, the pair quickly
        implemented a fix and restored the system. Despite the setback,
        their determination remained strong, and they successfully
        deployed the update before the deadline.
