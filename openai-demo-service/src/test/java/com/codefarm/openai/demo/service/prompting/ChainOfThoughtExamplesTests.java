/**
 * Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that guides large language models
 * to break down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps before providing a final answer.
 * 
 * This test class demonstrates how CoT prompting improves model accuracy compared to direct questioning,
 * by showing the model how to decompose problems into logical steps. The technique is particularly
 * effective for mathematical, temporal, and financial calculations.
 *
